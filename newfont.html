        <h1>TALES ARTE</h1>
        <p>EVERY YEAR I LIKE TO CREATE A NEW FONT FOR THE TAGS OF THE SEASON. MAYBE I’M HOMESICK BECAUSE IN 2023 I’VE DECIDED TO CREATE ONE FONT INSPIRED BY THE GRAFFITI OF PORTO ALEGRE AND SAO PAULO. </p>
        <p>I DESIGNED IT TO BE RAW AND DISRUPTIVE, MY MAIN GOAL WAS TO BRING BRUTALISM AND THE URBAN SPACE OF THE GLOBAL SOUTH TO DIFFERENT PLATFORMS AND WIDE CONTEXT. </p>
        <p>AS A FONT CREATED FOR TAGGING, I HAD TO WORK ON A FEW LINES THAT CAN EASILY BE PAINTED USING ROLL PAINT TECHNIQUE.         </p>
